## About Campus Connect

**Campus Connect** is an educational web application that provides convenient and high quality tutoring based on the current syllabus of a course, and not just the course’s topic. By providing students with certified tutors that students can select based on their preferences and compatibility, as well as additional practice problems generated using artificial intelligence, students are guaranteed to obtain the assistance they need to succeed.

### Our mission:
As students of University of Toronto, the team behind Campus Connect wants students’ questions answered successfully so they can enjoy their post-secondary experience even more. Each team member for Campus Connect has struggled during the first two years of post-secondary education. We all have made attempts to solve issues using services like **Office Hours** and **discussion boards**, but due to problems that we’ve encountered like crowded Office Hours or difficulty understanding explanations on discussion boards. We've all also had issues when trying to search for online resources for some convenient and quick assistance, but there have been many occurrences where we've encountered methodologies and topics that were not covered in our classes' syllabus.

**Turns out, we are not alone.** According to a **survey** we conducted with around **100** responses from post-secondary students,
* Around **90%** of students who have utilized their class’ discussion boards have experienced issues.
* Around **80%** who have attended Office Hours have experienced issues
* Around **75%** have tried using online resources, but encountered material not taught in the current iteration of their class.

These poor experiences from students who have a hard time with what's provided at school is what motivated the team to create Campus Connect.
