## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

**When:** July 19, 2024  
**Where:** Online (Discord)

### Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well
- **Discussing issues and getting help from other team members:** Regularly discussing problems and getting help from team members sped up problem-solving. This collaborative approach made sure we used everyone's expertise effectively, especially when we came across an issue.
- **Teamwork and good communication:** Effective teamwork and clear communication kept our project on track. By keeping everyone informed and engaged, we avoided misunderstandings and ensured all team members were aligned with the project goals.
- **Better time management:** Improved time management was crucial for our success this sprint. Setting clear priorities and following a structured schedule helped us complete tasks early, reducing stress and increasing productivity.
- **Better PR reviews:** Better PR reviews allowed us to identify and fix bugs early in the development process. This proactive approach improved code quality and reduced the time spent on debugging, resulting in a more stable product.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
- **Not understanding the full scope of some tickets/features:** One of the features turned out to be much harder than anticipated initially which led us to not being able to complete this feature. For the future, further research is required to see if certain functionalities and/or features require additional setup and applications required for completion.
- **Less testing:** We didn't conduct enough testing during the end of this sprint. This oversight meant that some bugs were found late in the process, which caused additional work and delays in fixing them.

### Planned changes
- **Spend more time discussing the scope of tickets and their feasibility:** We plan to spend more time discussing the details and requirements of tickets. This will help ensure everyone understands the scope and feasibility of the tasks, reducing confusion and delays.
- **Spending more time testing code for bugs:** We will allocate more time for testing our code thoroughly to catch and fix bugs early. This will help improve the quality of our code and prevent last-minute issues.

## Product - Review

### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
- Filter feature
- Tutor profile page + editing
- Rating and Feedback
- Record + View recordings

### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
- **AI transcript:** Integrating the AI transcript feature with Stream.io proved to be more challenging than initially anticipated. The current codebase infrastructure couldn't support this integration because Stream.io provided a video link of the meeting recording instead. Although we reached out to Stream.io developers for assistance, delays in their response and the sprint's scope prevented us from completing this feature on time.

### Meeting Highlights
- **Allocate more time for testing:** To prevent last-minute issues, we will dedicate more time to thoroughly test our code throughout the sprint. This will help catch bugs early and ensure a higher quality and more stable product.
- **Discuss scope and feasibility in depth:** We will spend more time discussing the scope and requirements of tickets and features at the start of each sprint. This will help ensure that everyone understands what is required and can plan accordingly, reducing confusion and delays later on.
