## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

- **When:** July 19, 2024
- **Where:** Online (Discord)

### Reflection

**Decisions that turned out well**

- **Understanding the full scope of tickets:** Understanding the full scope of our tickets was essential in ensuring we could complete all features on time. This clarity allowed us to plan our work accurately, allocate resources efficiently, and avoid unexpected issues. By thoroughly analyzing each ticket and its requirements, we could estimate the time and effort needed more precisely, leading to a smoother development process.

- **Better time management:** Continuing our improved time management practices was crucial for our ongoing success. Setting clear priorities and adhering to a structured schedule helped us stay on top of our tasks and meet deadlines consistently. This approach not only reduced stress but also increased our overall productivity. By maintaining this disciplined approach, we ensured that all team members could contribute effectively and efficiently to the project.

- **Preparing for the demo:** Preparing thoroughly before the demo was key to presenting our work confidently and professionally. This preparation involved ensuring all features were fully functional, testing for any bugs, and rehearsing our presentation. By allocating sufficient time for these activities, we were able to address potential issues beforehand and deliver a polished and impressive demo. This proactive approach helped us showcase our efforts effectively and made a positive impact on our stakeholders.

**Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped**

- **Lack of communication between team members:** Due to it being the end of the term, team members were very busy with other coursework, making it difficult to set up effective communication. This lack of communication led to misunderstandings and delays in our project. For the future, we need to establish a more robust communication plan that accommodates everyone's schedules and ensures consistent updates and collaboration.

- **Enhancing the design midway through the sprint:** Enhancing the design midway through the sprint turned out to be more challenging than anticipated. The changes introduced new complexities and required additional time for implementation, which impacted our ability to complete other planned tasks. For future sprints, it would be beneficial to finalize design decisions earlier in the process and avoid significant changes during the sprint unless absolutely necessary.

### Planned changes

- **Be clear with design from the beginning:** To avoid the issues we faced with design changes midway through the sprint, we plan to be clear with our design decisions from the beginning. This involves finalizing the design details during the planning phase and ensuring that all team members understand and agree on the design before we start development. By doing so, we can prevent disruptions and maintain a steady workflow.

- **Schedule and prioritize:** We will focus on better scheduling and prioritization to manage our time and resources more effectively. This means setting clear priorities for tasks, creating a structured schedule, and adhering to it throughout the sprint. By prioritizing tasks based on their importance and deadlines, we can ensure that critical features are completed on time and reduce last-minute rushes.

- **Communicate better with team members:** Improving communication with team members is a top priority. We plan to establish more reliable communication channels and set regular check-ins to ensure everyone stays informed and engaged. By fostering a culture of open and consistent communication, we can avoid misunderstandings, address issues promptly, and ensure that all team members are aligned with our project goals.

There are opportunities to further develop our technical expertise, improve our workflow, and tackle more challenging projects. We are excited about applying what we've learned to future endeavors and continuing our professional development.

- **Better communication:** We recognized the importance of better communication and have committed to improving this aspect in future projects. Establishing clear communication channels and regular check-ins will help us stay informed, aligned, and efficient. By fostering an environment of open and transparent communication, we can enhance our teamwork and project outcomes.
