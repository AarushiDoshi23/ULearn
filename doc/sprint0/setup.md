# Setup
To start contributing, you will need **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine, which can be installed on any Operating System.
#### [Click here to install Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
More info about installing Node.js and npm can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Next, **clone** the repo to your local machine. Open the terminal/console in the repo's directory on your machine. Create a branch using `git checkout -b branch-name`. *Make sure you follow the branch naming scheme described in the README*.

Next, in your terminal/console, type:
`npm install -g npm`.

Once **npm** is installed, you need to install all dependencies. To do this, type this in your terminal/console:
`npm install`

To run the app on your local environment, type:
`npm start`
Congratulations! The program should be up and running at http://localhost:3000. Changes should update live.
