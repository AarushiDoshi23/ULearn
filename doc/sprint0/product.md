#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

To evaluate interest in our product, we conducted a survey using convenience and volunteer sampling of 97 students in Ontario post-secondary, with the majority from UofT. What we first found is that 60% of the students have had questions about their course material, but didn’t know who to ask. Our product is here to fill that space.

Of course, there are tons of tutoring services out there. Or, even free lessons online on Youtube and other platforms. This isn’t anything new. However, the problem with that is how different the teachings of that service may be from the course content being taught. Even across campuses of UofT, the courses can be wildly different. In fact, 73.2% of students in our survey have already tried using external resources for help, but found that the results were not relevant to their courses. Our product is designed to solve this issue, by connecting students with tutors who have taken their exact course from their University.

What about Office Hours? Being able to learn directly from TA’s and Professors sounds like the perfect solution. Except sometimes students don’t just have a simple question to ask, 72.2% of students had difficulty with a course topic as a whole. Or when they do, 65% of students have experienced being unable to make it to Office Hours because there just may not be any scheduled, or students are in lectures at that time. Sometimes, even though they could, 72.2% of students have felt it was too inconvenient to travel all the way to campus. 

Of the 83 surveyed students who have gone to Office Hours, 94% of them have indicated unideal experiences, with 80% of students feeling like they are too crowded. As well as the majority either needing more time to address their questions (56.6%) or even having their questions answered at all (53%).

Now this is where our product comes in, we aren’t suggesting we could replace Office Hours, but rather that we can fill the void. With tutoring, students can spend as much time as they need to understand their topic in a private one on one setting, avoiding the crowds. And with our online optional sessions, students don’t need to travel. With each tutor having their own hours, we bring more flexibility to support students in addition to Office Hours.

Although Piazza is great and flexible, allowing students to ask questions anytime, of the 71 students who have used Piazza, 90% responded that they have experienced difficulties using Piazza. The majority of them found that it was difficult to understand responses through text (60.1%). As well, around half of them felt it was too difficult to explain themselves through text (49.3%) and receive further explanations on their follow-up questions (48%). This is why our product plans to have a voice call feature in online-sessions, as well as a whiteboard feature for tutors and students to draw out any graphs that may benefit them. Furthermore, 53.5% of students have expressed concern over whether the responses to their Piazza questions are reputable, since any student can respond. To combat this, we want to vet tutors by checking for their achievement in their course, and implementing a feedback system for our tutors.

Of the sample students surveyed, 94.8% indicated interest in the services we plan to offer. For tutoring specifically, 72.2% showed interest, and 60% indicated they would be willing to pay hourly for the tutoring services.
