#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

The target users for our CampusConnect app will be a combination of both students receiving tutoring services and students providing tutoring. These will be primarily 18-22 year olds attending the University of Toronto, with a wide variety of diverse backgrounds. Students looking to receive tutoring services could be doing so for several reasons. One expected group of users looking for tutoring is first-year students struggling with the adjustment to university after high school. They will greatly benefit from the mentorship and guidance that upper-year tutors would provide, along with the personalized assistance on first-year course material. Other students who would use CampusConnect for tutoring services are those frustrated with the current academic resources available such as course websites including Piazza, discussion boards, office hours, and TA assistance. 

The second group of users for CampusConnect are students willing to provide tutoring services. These students would likely be in their upper years of university and potentially have work experience through internships or other transferable skills. Many of these users would have received high grades in their past courses and would benefit from a platform to share their knowledge with those who need it. It would also be useful for those looking to add experiences to their resumes ahead of an upcoming job search. Any students looking to earn an extra income to help pay for tuition fees, rent, or other living expenses would also be attracted to our application. Overall, a variety of student users would benefit from our application.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

A survey was conducted to evaluate interest in the product. By means of convenience and volunteer sampling, a total of 97 Ontario post-secondary students were sampled with the most common student from UofT. Of the students sampled, 60% shared experiences of having questions about their course material but not knowing who they could ask. CampusConnect aims to provide a space for students to seek help on their courses.

There are a lot of resources on the web students may turn to, and that many already use, like other tutoring services or lessons on Youtube. However, as course content varies greatly even across campuses, and especially across Universities, students can struggle to find relevant results to their courses. From the sampled students, 73.2% have tried using external resources for help, but found that the results were not relevant to their courses. CampusConnect was designed around this issue, by connecting students with tutors who have taken their exact course from their University.

Within Universities, Professors and TAâ€™s offer Office Hours for the courses they teach, which appears as the most direct and reputable source of guidance for students. However, some students have difficulty with a course topic rather than a clear question to ask, this was noted by 72.2% of sampled students. Additionally, students (65% of sampled) can find it difficult to arrive at Office Hours due to unavailability of the OH or their own unavailability. If not due to the lack of availability, many students, 72.2% of sampled, have felt the inconvenience of the commute to campus too great. Through the online service and the variety of tutors CampusConnect aims to offer, students will be able to additionally, alongside OH, benefit from flexible hours without requiring leaving their homes.

Of the 83 surveyed students who have gone to Office Hours, 94% of them have indicated unideal experiences, with 80% of students feeling like they are too crowded. As well as the majority either needing more time to address their questions (56.6%) or even having their questions answered at all (53%). For those students who feel they may need more time to have their questions adequately addressed, or who just prefer a more private setting, CampusConnect offers one-on-one tutoring for as long as students need.

Another popular option for students is Piazza, a flexible alternative to allow students to ask questions anytime. Yet, of the 71 sampled students who have used Piazza, 90% responded that they have experienced difficulties using Piazza. The majority of them found that it was difficult to understand responses through text (60.1%). As well, around half of them felt it was too difficult to explain themselves through text (49.3%) and receive further explanations on their follow-up questions (48%). This is what led CampusConnect to decide to integrate a voice call feature in online-sessions, as well as screen sharing, so that students and tutors can express their thoughts clearly. Furthermore, 53.5% of students have expressed concern over whether the responses to their Piazza questions are reputable, since any student can respond to them. To combat this, CampusConnect wants to vet tutors by checking for their achievement in their course, experience in teaching, and implementing a feedback system for tutors.

CampusConnect sees potential in students benefiting from the services offered, and students see it too. Of the sample students surveyed, 94.8% indicated interest in services planned to be offered. For tutoring specifically, 72.2% showed interest, and of the interested students, 82.9% indicated they would be willing to pay hourly for the tutoring services.
